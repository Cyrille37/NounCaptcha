NounCaptcha is a simple but pleasant visual captcha plugin witch use drawings from The Noun Project http://TheNounProject.

== Description ==

NounCaptcha is a simple but pleasant visual captcha plugin, witch try to recognize human visitor.

It use drawings from The Noun Project http://TheNounProject, witch I love ;-)

NounCaptcha works only with images, no sound, so it is not accessible to blind people, I'm sorry.
The plugin works alone, on your Wordpress instance, without API or other third party web site.
Captcha are defined in text file, in INI file format, so it's very easy to change or create questions.
You can define catpcha for several languages.

= Todo =

* On WP frontend
 * Remember the captcha response after comming back from comment's submit error page

* On WP backend
 * check validity of captcha.txt files
 * show drawings of selected theme
 * Permit to random select a drawings theme
